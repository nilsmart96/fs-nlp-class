    "# Welcome to your second class - NLP Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is focused on applying **machine learning techniques** to **gain language understanding**. **Natural language processing** is one of the main sub-fields of machine learning and has **driven major algorithmic break-throughs** in recent years. Language is a form of time series so breakthroughs in natural language processing such as Transformers have been closely connected to advances in machine learning in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "The module is thus taking a **twofold approach**. On the one hand we will introduce **general machine learning techniques** that can deal with **categorical time series** and show how they can be **effectively applied to give computers language** understanding. On the other hand, we will combine these techniques with **domain specific applications** such as **word embedding, semantic distance and dependency tree parsing**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The module focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Main concepts and intuition of how language can be processed and language understanding be gained through machine learning\n",
    " - Central topics in NLP \n",
    "         - Syntax\n",
    "         - Semantics\n",
    "         - Combining elements of syntax and semantics to build problem specific pipelines\n",
    "         - Large language models that do end to end learning\n",
    " - Will take a historical view, moving from what used to be state of the art to current state of the art\n",
    " - Note that past techniques are not just relevant for historical reasons but feature in most practical engineering problems in some form or another\n",
    " - Intuition based -> not too formal\n",
    " - Practical focus -> implement every day!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limits\n",
    "- Basic introduction, tip of the ice-berg\n",
    "- Try to focus on getting across the most important concepts rather than the full breadth of the material\n",
    "- Intense, short time frame\n",
    " \n",
    "## After this class you should be able to..\n",
    "- **Understand** the latest **machine learning techniques** to gain **language understanding** through computational techniques.\n",
    "- **Translate** the knowledge gained on NLP algorithms to **novel language processing problems**.\n",
    "- Apply natural language processing techniques to **business problems** e.g. to **better understand the sentiment of customers, their needs and how they may be persuaded**.\n",
    "- **Analyze** the **most advanced machine learning techniques such as Transformers** in a domain specific context, in our case **natural language processing**.\n",
    "- Evaluate which **pipeline, model and architecture** are **most appropriate for a problem**, based on accuracy and convergence metrics of the optimization\n"
