    "# Semantics in general\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Semantics ... is the linguistic and philosophical **study of meaning**, in language, programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics. It is concerned with the relationship between **signifiers** — like words, phrases, signs, and symbols — and what they stand for, their **denotation**.\" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)\n",
    "\n",
    "In semantics, we step over the study of the linguistic signifiers, their structural properties, and we try to establish a **connection between the signs and the original entities and events they are intended to represent**. As such, semantics has strong connections with philosophy, since it tries to capture the inner processes of meaning creation (eg. Why and how do we get to the meaning of utterances?) and their \"truth value\" (eg. Is this a true proposition?).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in itself a huge problem in philosophy of language, how we can  establish any kind of connections between words and \"meanings\". In the early 20th century the rising school of analytic philosophy, and it's founding father **Gottlob Frege** elaborated a system, in which all meanings have to be **connected to \"senses\", which are in themselves atomic and factual**, thus enabling an analytic discussion of true propositions. (see [Frege's Theory of Sense and Denotation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/#FreTheSenDen)) This view heavily influenced early semantic technologies, especially the \"ontological\" paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this paradigm tells us: **a word's meaning is what it \"points to\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand the in the **later works of Wittgenstein** we witness a shift even inside the analytical philosophy tradition towards a strong **emphasis on the conventional, contextual mechanisms** that underlie the creation of meaning. (see the concept of [language games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy))) This position emphasizes, that context and (interpersonal) usage are the foundational aspects of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this paradigm tells us: **a word's meaning is how we use it (in context)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dichotomy of approaches will strongly inform the different modeling solutions for semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lexical semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early days \n",
    "\n",
    "In it's simplest and naive form semantics presupposes, that based on the compositional structure of language, we can **trace back the meaning of complex propositions to individual signifiers, and some production rules** that govern the construction of meaning from these simple elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus semantics in this simple sense is: **meaningful words + production rules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take on this view, it is all the more natural, that we propose: there is a fixed set of meaningful words, that form part of the **lexicon**, thus if we can capture the **definitions and relations** of lexical words, we created a base description of knowledge. This view can be traced back as to at least the work of great **encyclopedists** of the Enlightenment movement and MUCH before.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Pavao_Skali%C4%87%3B_Enciklopedija_ili_znanje_svijeta_svetih_i_svjetovnih_struka_%281559%29.jpg\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CAMS8bYmniJyRnAXJE6qrQDZgDfPT6Jf\" width=40%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "(First known mention of the word \"encyclopedia\" in a book's title from 1559.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Though - as  Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia), itself also THE encyclopedia notes:\n",
    "\"Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. Generally speaking, unlike dictionary entries — which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms — encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a murky boundary between such linguistic and lexicographic resources, depending on how we understand \"define\", as well as some deeper paradoxes about the relationship between a definition of a word and the word itself (see **[Paradox of Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_analysis))**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexical relations\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexical semantic resources - beside the possible definitions of the \"lexemes\" themselves, importantly contain information about **relations** between individual units of meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synonymy\n",
    "\n",
    "Defines a relationship between to lexemes that mean (roughly) the same (in a given context).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "Love\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Noun\n",
    "    \n",
    "S: (n) love (a strong positive emotion of regard and affection) \"his love for his work\"; \"children need a lot of love\"\n",
    "S: (n) love, passion (any object of warm affection or devotion) \"the theater was her first love\"; \"he has a passion for cock fighting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "S: (n) love (a score of zero in tennis or squash) \"it was 40 love\"\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Please observe, that there is a really problematic entry also, which acts totally differently, though in the semantic resource quoted ([WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=love&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=000000000000000000)) it is quite misleadingly marked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homonymy\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a quite frequent and annoying habit of us humans, to denote quite different entities and phenomena with the same names:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "Noun\n",
    "    \n",
    "S: (n) bank (sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)) \"they pulled the canoe up on the bank\"; \"he sat on the bank of the river and watched the currents\"\n",
    "S: (n) depository financial institution, bank, banking concern, banking company (a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities) \"he cashed a check at the bank\"; \"that bank holds the mortgage on my home\"\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "S: (n) bank (a flight maneuver; aircraft tips laterally about its longitudinal axis (especially in turning)) \"the plane went into a steep bank\"\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great source of humor and an annoyance for us doing NLP, thus the lexicons usually include this relationship, but often in the form of different \"meanings\", eg. **bank(1), bank(2)** or **\"synonym sets\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antonymy\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we have a common sense understanding of dichotomies \"good - bad\" and so forth, the antonymy (\"opposite of\") relation does entail contradictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is the opposite of a good laugh a bad laugh or a good cry?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Hyponymy and hypernymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a strict philosophical sense the hypernymy - hyponymy relation should represent the \"genus-species\" relation, meaning: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "dog (noun) -- is_a --> animal (noun)\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...Genus is that part of a definition which is also predicable of other things different from the definiendum. A triangle is a rectilinear figure; i.e. in fixing the genus of a thing, we subsume it under a higher universal, of which it is a species.\" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(philosophy))\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we conceptualize this relation as **transferring all (???) the properties of the higher category** to the lower \"instance\". (\"Inheritance relation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meronymy\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"part of\" relation should represent some taxative listing of the constituents for an entity. It is itself a distinct topic of philosophy called [\"mereology\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology), which struggles with the problems of how attributes of parts and wholes relate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of \"part\" is problematic, usually presupposing some kind of practical decomposability, thus we are not inclined to say:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "atom (noun) -- part_of --> dog (noun)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more likely:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "tail (noun) -- part_of --> dog (noun)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "leg (noun) -- part_of --> dog (noun)\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also unclear, what constitute essential parts of objects, thus is it always true, that (poor) dog has to have legs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ontologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Aka. semantic networks - aiming to be complete (???) and systematic (???) descriptions of a domain of knowledge. \n",

    "\n",
    "They typically utilize some additional, custom relations besides the ones listed above, which make sense in a given domain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rise and shine of ontologies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision of the semantic web\n",
    "\n",
    "Though from the perspective of the recent statistical revolution the ontological approach to semantics may seem outdated, we have to draw attention to a **\"small side-effect\"** of this research are, we call **\"the World Wide Web\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sidenote: How the \"web\" came to be\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Heavily Tagged Markup Language\" - better known as **HTML**, which is the definitive document format enabling the \"Web\" (transported via the HTML Transport Protocol - aka. HTTP) - was an early product of the \"knowledge description\" approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, HTML documents were created to use **\"semantic tags\"** to mark meaningful **structural parts** and **metadata** of documents, as well as connections between documents in the form of **\"links\"**. The goal was to capture the meaning and relatedness of pieces of knowledge in **machine readable form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noone could foretell, that the original intended purpose - to codify the knowledge of physics at the laboratories of CERN and beyond - would be quickly eclipsed by the publication of \"kitties\", and thus forming the current web we know. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2018/10/18/w3c_logo-800x400.jpg\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=16Akuz8OdYkftyyMA6r7ZPoFN0gPEmbd2\" width=30%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning, that the original **semantic** use of HTML was utterly corrupted by the early web's content creators, for example the use of **table tags** (\"td\", \"tr\"...) for visually positioning text for **display** purposes (instead of encoding the meaning of \"an inserted table starts here\") spiraled out of control, thus the entity defining the standards, the World Wide Web Consotrium (**\"W3C\"**) had to intervene. This marks the birth of [**\"tableless design\"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableless_web_design), whereby the visual presentation properties of a document are clearly sparated by \"cascading style sheets\" **(CSS)** elements from the semantic structure marked in HTML. (And the executable logic represented by embedded JavaScript.)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Extension of the web\n",
    "\n",
    "The original concept of capturing and descibing knowledge in form of documents was greatly extended by the movement of the **\"semantic web\"**. The metadata initiative of the [\"Dublin Core\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core) extended the description and mapping efforts to books, films and various other media (the notion of \"multimedia\" became prevalent).\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic web effort - aiming to \"link\" and \"describe\" all knowledge in a machine readable, processable form, lending itself to **\"machine reasoning\"** culminated in the creation of the [**Resource Description Framework\" (RDF)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.michelepasin.org/upload/researcher/software/CohereOnto.png\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1QUweM5HgJU_pQa6YIc8Qxp4sCpfMYdjW\" width=25%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The RDF concept is a flexible, general purpose format - based on the [**\"eXtended Markup Language\" (XML)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) - to describe conceptual relations in form of **triplets**, like \"dog, is_a, animal\" readable for computers. The grand vision of semantic web was to thoroughly annotate each online content element and computationally accessible **resource** with **\"Universal Resource Identifiers\" (URI)**, and build an all encompassing knowledge network, so that machines can easily reason over it. If the propositions and commands coming from \"natural human language\" can be mapped to structured queries over RDF stores [(**SPARQL Queries**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) retrieval of relevant content an execution of commands would be solved.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this to be achievable, we would need to define an overarching common sense **ontology** of things' meaning (as well as all subdomains). The original idea was to create a specific language that can serve as a basis for building up such knowledge base ontologies in form of the [\"Web Ontology Language\" (OWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language). \n",

    "\n",
    "Though OWL strived to become a standard for knowledge representation, it did not become as wide-spread as hoped for - partially because technical problems (see below), but partially based on lack or incentives (or presence of **destructive ones**). (For some illustration take the example of **\"meta\" tags** mentioned [here](https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html). )\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the semantic web brings with it the stories of human failure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"In a 2004 paper, Ben Munat, then an academic at Evergreen State College, explains how search engines once experimented with using keywords supplied via the `<meta>` tag to index results, but soon discovered that unscrupulous webpage authors were including tags unrelated to the actual content of their webpage. As a result, search engines came to ignore the `<meta>` tag in favor of using complex algorithms to analyze the actual content of a webpage. Munat concludes that a general-purpose Semantic Web is unworkable, and that the focus should be on specific domains within medicine and science.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Development costs\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of detailed domain ontologies usually requires intense work from a committee of highly skilled experts who - when they are able to agree upon the exact terminology - will have to commit substantial resources just to cover even partially a domain.\n",

    "See more on ontology development below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the presence or absence of \"edges\" in a semantic network are general in nature, it is very difficult to denote relations which are only true in a definite context.\n",

    "\n",
    "[\"Expert systems\"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence/artificial_intelligence_expert_systems.htm) have been considered prime forms of artificial intelligence (after the first AI winter).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core notion of these systems was the capture and formal codification of expert knowledge in a specific field, say chemical engineering, and creation of systems capable of \"reasoning\" in the given domain. The knowledge representation could be a set of rules, but many times was a kind of ontology, describing the relationships between elements and entities of a domain. \n",

    "\n",
    "A good example would be a medical self-diagnosis system, where the domain knowledge of doctors have been represented in a knowledge base, the user gives in a query with her symptoms, the system \"traverses\" possible avenues of reasoning, asks back if needed, then comes up with a possible diagnosis or suggestion for the user.\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite all the above mentioned criticism, there are definitely **some cases when ontologies work exceptionally well**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites for this are (amongst others):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well scoped domain (narrow and defined enough, has experts)\n",
    "- Defined, well codified domain knowledge (experts can agree)\n",
    "- Usage of terminology is consistent, can be easily mapped to eg. documents\n",
    "- Fundamental relations do not change too frequently \n",
